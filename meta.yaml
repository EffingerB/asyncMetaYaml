# This file has to be in the Players folder to take effect, keeping the "meta.yaml" name
# A meta file rolls its own set of options first
# The result will then overwrite each player's option in that particular field
# For example, if a meta.yaml fast_ganon result is rolled, every player will have that fast_ganon goal
# There is the special case of null, which ignores that part of the meta.yaml,
# allowing for a chance for that meta to not take effect
meta_description: Meta-Mystery file with the intention of having similar-length completion times for a hopefully better experience
null:
  progression_balancing: # Progression balancing tries to make sure that the player has *something* towards any players goal in each "sphere"
    normal: 0 # Force every player into default progression balancing
    disabled: 1 # Force every player out of progression balancing, then prepare for a lot of logical BK
    null: 0 # Let players decide via their own progression_balancing setting in their yaml, defaulting to 50
